            distributed from southeastern Mexico to the Amazon River. They thrive in hot, humid areas within about 20 degrees of the equator,
        according to Cornell. As the popularity of the Chocolate spread, growers established plantations in other regions, such as West Africa 
    and South and Southeast Asia. Today, Ghana, CÃ´te d'Ivoire, Nigeria, Indonesia and Brazil accout for 79 percent of the world's cacao production.</p>
