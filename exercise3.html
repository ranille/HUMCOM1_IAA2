<center>FILIPINO SWEET STYLE SPAGHETTI </center> </h3>

    <h3><font size="4"> Introduction  </font></h3>
 <p><font size="3">For this month theme, I made a long list of all the Filipino dishes I love to eat during my birthday and I’ve noticed I never actually cooked Filipino Sweet Style Spaghetti yet from scratch.&nbsp; “From scratch” in Cusinera’s term is when you don’t use a sachet or tetra pack and then add meat.&nbsp; The sauce has to be sweet, savoury, a bit reddish/orangey in colour and the sauce have to be thick not watery, with this knowledge I dived into my pantry and fridge just to get the ingredients that will give me that ultimate recipe without the aid of the magic instant sauce.</font></p>

  <p><font size="3">What’s not to love about Filipino Sweet Style Spaghetti, a must for a Pinoy children’s birthday party along with fried chicken and hotdogs on bamboo skewers with a marshmallow on each end.&nbsp; Let’s not forget the triangular sandwiches that are filled with shredded chicken with mayonnaise, freshly cooked Pork BBQ Sticks and for dessert…tubs of Magnolia Ice Cream and slices of the Birthday Cake.&nbsp; I love this 80’s style children buffet party food spread, and always include most of the dishes in my children’s parties.&nbsp; </font></p>
  <p><font size="3">So let me bring back your childhood birthday party memories with my version of this iconic Filipino pasta….only in the Philippines!</font></p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>COOKING PROCEDURE:</strong></p> 
        <p><font size="3">1. In medium-high, heat your cooking oil in a large frying pan and sauté your garlic and onions till they become transparent.&nbsp; Add in your mince beef and while stirring, make sure you break down the meat clumps.&nbsp; Throw in a good pinch of salt and pepper over the mince beef.&nbsp; Once the mince beef are all evenly browned, add in your sliced hotdogs and cook further for a 15-30 seconds.</font>
    </p> 
    <p> 
        <p><font size="3">2.&nbsp; Pour in your tomato sauce, ketchup, water, cheese and milk.&nbsp; Stir the sauce well on each addition.&nbsp; Reduce the heat to simmering stage.</font>
    </p> 
            
     <p><font size="3">3.&nbsp; Once the sauce is slowly simmering, add in your sugar and cornflour slurry (*stir the slurry before your pour*).&nbsp; Once you pour your cornflour slurry you have to quickly stir it in to the sauce to avoid lumps.&nbsp; Cook the sauce till it becomes slightly thickened.&nbsp; Remove from stove and set aside.</font>
        </p> 
              
    <p><font size="3">4.&nbsp; Boil some water with a good pinch of salt.&nbsp; Once the water is boiling pour in your pasta.&nbsp; Reduce your heat to medium and simmer the pasta for 10-14 minutes or until it is soft but not overcook.&nbsp; Pour the spaghetti over a colander to remove water.</font></p>

                 <p><font size="3">5.&nbsp; In a large oven proof bowl, place the drained pasta and pour over 75% of the sauce and mix them together.&nbsp; *You can add another 1/2 cup of grated tasty cheese* if you want while mixing.&nbsp; Top with the leftover sauce and add more extra cheese.&nbsp; Bake inside your oven till the cheese on top are completely melted.&nbsp; Remove from the oven and serve.</font></p>

                        <p><font size="3"><strong></strong></font>&nbsp;</p>
                         <p><font size="3"><strong>BEST WITH:</strong>&nbsp; Crispy Fried Chicken or with Chicken Mayo Spread Sandwiches on the side.</font></p>
                          <p><strong><font size="3">NOTES:</font></strong></p>
                           <ul>
                               <li><font size="3">The pasta should be soft but not overcook.&nbsp; It should be past the al dente stage, when you bite one of the spaghetti strands, it should not have that hard middle to it. Another way to check the pasta is to cut it and check if there is still white in the middle, if it is white then it still need to be cook. &nbsp; Once you achieve this, drain the spaghetti quickly and lightly rinse with cold water from the tap while it’s still on the colander. This is to avoid for the pasta to be overcook by its heat, if not it would be saggy. </font></li>
                            </ul> 
                               <ul>
                                    <li><font size="3">Make 1 1/2 recipe of the sauce for 500g spaghetti (uncooked) if&nbsp; you prefer more sauce in your pasta. </font></li>
                                </ul> 
                                <ul> 
                                    <li><font size="3">Use 3/4 cup of tomato sauce (condiment version) instead of 1 cup if you want to reduce the tomatoey tartness of the sauce. </font></li>
                                </ul>
                               <ul>
                                    <li><font size="3">You can cook this sauce in big batches and divide them into containers to freeze for future use. </font></li>
                                </ul>
                                     <ul>
                                          <li><font size="3">The TRIBE likes to mix the sauce with the pasta before serving and lightly bake it, but if you like to serve the sauce and pasta separately on the table or just top the sauce on the pasta for individual plating go right ahead….there’s no right or wrong=)&nbsp; Enjoy!</font>&nbsp; </li>
